# magic-8-ball


For my final project, I wanted to build something fun and lighthearted. So, I created a Magic 8 Ball / fortune-teller simulator in Python. It’s a simple question-and-answer game.

When you run the program, it asks for your name, then makes you  ask yes/no questions. In return, it gives you a randomly selected fortune or answer. It also saves every question and answer into a personal `.json` file so you can look back on your past predictions.


# what I used

- **Python classes** 
- **Functions** 
- **`random` module** 
- **`json` module** 
- **`datetime`** 

# how to Use It

1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter your name.
3. Ask any yes or no question.
4. Get your “fortune” from the Magic 8 Ball.
5. Type `history` to view past questions and predictions.
6. Type `quit` when you're done.
